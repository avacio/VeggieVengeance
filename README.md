# OVERVIEW

It is 3019, and with the fatal global food crisis, overpopulation, and unsustainable habits, humans have laid waste to both themselves, and the planet. In retaliation, Mother Nature has granted its babies — its vegetables from vast valleys — sentience. That’s right! These legumes and roots have gained intelligence, and this time, they are back with a vengeance! With humans down for the count, it’s time to establish a new world order. There is only room for one vegetable at the top of this food chain, and those who can’t take the heat must get out of the kitchen! Which vegetable will prevail among the seeds? Play to find out! The game supports multiple fighters and provides selection for multiple stages. Players fight as vegetable characters, each with their own set of unique abilities. Veggie Vengeance is a recipe for trouble.

Veggie Vengeance is a 2D fighting game made by Madison Graf, Wesley Yuen, Michael Zhang, Ali Arbabian, Jen Deluz, and Alexis Gervacio. This game won runner-up in the CPSC436D showcase, as judged by industry pros from Electronic Arts, Skybox Labs, etc.

# ROBUST MILESTONE PROGRESS - Mar. 29



Overview: For this milestone, we continued to introduce new features such as characters, abiltiies and stages, while also fixing and optimizing the performance.



## Milestone Requirements


- Provide complete playable prior-milestone implementation
	- features from previous milestones are kept and improved upon (e.g. abilities rework)
    
- Sustain progressive, non-repetitive gameplay for 6min or more including all new features. The game should not terminate early and should allow infinite even if repetitive gameplay
	- Complete menu system, allowing for non-repetitive gameplay e.g. rematches, switching characters, stage select
	- New Fighters
		- Eggplant: Circling emojis, emoji bullets
		- Yam: Self-healing, dash
	- New fighting abilties
		- Potato: Tater tot bomb, chargable bullets (fries)
		- Broccoli: Uppercut, chargable projectiles (cauliflowers)
	- balancing states
		- introduced tired-out state if players are abusing the charged abilities (fighter tired out if holding abilities for too long) 
	- more platforms (resembling battlefield in smash)

- Support real-time response rate (i.e. lag-free input).
	- gameplay are lag-free
	- optimize loading and unloading resources -> reduced loading match time to under 1 sec

- Include proper memory management (no excessive allocation or leaks). The game should not have any undefined behavior, memory leaks or random crashes. The game should not hog memory even after extended play time. 
	- resources e.g. bomb, bullets, projectiles are destroyed
	- memory usage usually plateaus at around 256MB

- The game should robustly handle any user input. Unexpected inputs or environment settings should be correctly handled and reported

- The gameplay should be real-time (no lag). This included improving your collision handling using effective detection strategies. You should support dozens simultaneously moving main or background assets
	- smooth collision detection for characters, platforms, spawned assets (bomb, bullets, projectiles)

- The game should allow for some form of state saving for play “reload”. Users should be able to pause and restart in a graceful (if not perfect) manner. 
	- matches can be paused and restart gracefully

- The physical effects should be correctly integrated in time and should not be locked to the machine’s speed by correctly handling the simulation time step and integration.

- Stable game code supporting continuing execution and graceful termination.


Creative: You should implement one or more additional creative elements. These can include additional integrated assets or rendering effects or pre-emptive implementation of one or more features from subsequent milestones.
	
- Planned Work
	- new animations:
		- Charging, tired out, death for all fighters
	- new fighter moves:
		- different projectile types
        	- bouncy cauliflower
            - circling emojis that you can fire
        - tater tot bombs
    - mesh
    	- knives
    - stage select
    - eggplant character with sprites
    - refined animations for player states
- Unplanned Work
	- stage effect of falling knives with collision and attack damage
    - add yam character with sprites!

 		- Bullet (linear projectile)
		- Projectile (parabolic projectile)
 		- Power punching (charging up a punch that deals more damage)
	- platform + enviornmental death (falling)

- Implement time stepping based physical animation: A subset of the game entities (main or background) should now possess non-trivial physics properties such as linear momentum or angular momentum, and acceleration and 
  act based on those. Specifically, you should implement some form of physical simulation, which can be either background effects (e.g. water, smoke implemented using particles) or active game elements (throwing a ball,
  swinging a rope, etc…)
	- gravity-based acceleration
	- physical simulation for fighter moves
 		- projectile (parabolic projectile using gravity)
        
- Incorporate one or more polygonal geometric assets 
	- creating mesh on Blender (chef hat), still in progress
- Implement smooth non-linear motion of one or more assets or characters 
	- jumping for all characters are gravity-based (force)
    
- Implement an accurate and efficient collision detection method (include multiple moving assets that necessitate collision checks)
	- fighters/projectiles/bullets/platforms all require collision checks
    
- Stable game code supporting continuing execution and graceful termination.
	- polished paused menu
 		- fixed: pausing all background actions
		- resume: supporting continuing execution
		- going back to main menu: allow players to switch modes without closing the game
		- quit: graceful termination
    - game over screen
    	- quit, return to menu, restart
    - character select screen
    	- AI changes based on character type that is currently selected
        - shows stats
        - will determine actual player type

Creative: You should implement one or more additional creative elements. These can include additional integrated assets or rendering effects or pre-emptive implementation of one or more features from subsequent milestones.
